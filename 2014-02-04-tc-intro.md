# Introduction #

I work in financial service industry as a development manager and have been living with data (and lots of dirty data) for 10+ years. Originally graduated with a computer science degree, I never consider myself as a good programmer. But I enjoy implementing beautiful GUI design when I can. 

In terms of programming experience, I started my career as a web developer. Nowadays my strongest is in SQL database and C# is next. I am new to Python, D3, Git and GitHub. In my spare time, I do volunteer work on Sunday and continue in investing and build trading systems with structured data gathered from different sources.

Coming out of the certification program, I am hoping to gain basic knowledge in machine learning and learn the latest tools for data analysis and visualization. In the mid term goal, I'll continue to pursuit my big data ideas in the company.
